# Intro
I am a co-founder and the CEO of [Latch.Bio](https://latch.bio) where I help with product and other things that help bioinformaticians build and deploy pipelines faster and at scale. I dropped out of UC Berkeley where I was studying EECS and Math and leading ML@B. I was born and raised in Mexico. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At LatchBio we are redefining the potential of software and data within biotech. I am personally learning how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, make customers happy, and build communities. I am constatly ramping up on bio.
